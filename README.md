# flagsmith-common
Flagsmith's common library

### Development Setup

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management and includes a Makefile to simplify common development tasks.

#### Prerequisites

- Python >= 3.10
- Make

#### Installation

You can set up your development environment using the provided Makefile:

```bash
# Install everything (pip, poetry, and project dependencies)
make install

# Individual installation steps are also available
make install-pip       # Upgrade pip
make install-poetry    # Install Poetry
make install-packages  # Install project dependencies
```

By default, Poetry version 2.0.1 will be installed. You can specify a different version:

```bash
make install-poetry POETRY_VERSION=2.1.0
```

#### Development

Run linting checks using pre-commit:

```bash
make lint
```

Additional options can be passed to the `install-packages` target:

```bash
# Install with development dependencies
make install-packages opts="--with dev"

# Install with specific extras
make install-packages opts="--extras 'feature1 feature2'"
```

### Usage

#### Installation

1. Make sure `"common.core"` is in the `INSTALLED_APPS` of your settings module.
This enables the `manage.py flagsmith` commands.

2. Add `"common.gunicorn.middleware.PrometheusGunicornLoggerMiddleware"` to `MIDDLEWARE` in your settings module. This enables the `path` label for Prometheus HTTP metrics.

#### Metrics

Flagsmith uses Prometheus to track performance metrics.

The following default metrics are exposed:

- `flagsmith_build_info`: Has the labels `version` and `ci_commit_sha`.
- `http_server_request_duration_seconds`: Histogram labeled with `method`, `path`, and `response_status`.
- `http_server_requests_total`: Counter labeled with `method`, `path`, and `response_status`.

##### Guidelines

Try to come up with meaningful metrics to cover your feature with when developing it. Refer to [Prometheus best practices][1] when naming your metric and labels.

Define your metrics in a `metrics.py` module of your Django application â€” see [example][2]. Contrary to Prometheus Python client examples and documentation, please name a metric variable exactly as your metric name.

The Prometheus client runs in multi-process mode to accommodate for [Gunicorn server model][3]. When defining a `Gauge` metric, select the appropriate `multiprocess_mode` for it. Refer to the [Metrics tuning][4] section of Prometheus Python client documentation. Usually, the appropriate mode is `livesum`, which aggregates values from all live Gunicorn workers.

Flagsmith assumes missing or null metric label values as unknown, and converts them to an `"unknown"` constant value. To support the convention, use the `with_labels` utility function when labelling your metric sample:

```python
from common.prometheus.utils import with_labels

from yourapp import metrics

def get_galaxy() -> str | None: ...

with_labels(
    metrics.planets_in_universe_total,
    galaxy=get_galaxy(),
).inc(1)
```
